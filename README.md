# A-DND-Story-Theandra-s-Underworld-Path

A small rpg about a dragonborn life cleric that was killed by a fiend and this intervened with the normal path she has to take in the Underworld.

## Disclaimer

This is a side project I'm doing to warm up before developing another game.
I just do this for fun so expect a small number of updates.
I also may leave it unfinished when I get bored, I'm just using git because I like to be organized.
